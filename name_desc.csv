Description: Turning a fan-favorite genre on its head, the hyper-addictive Mad Skills Motocross plays and feels like no other side-scrolling racing game. The unparalleled physics engine and unexpected power-ups give you a level of control that you have to play to believe. Launch off an enormous jump, land on your rear wheel, hit the throttle, and leave your opponent in a spray of dirt—then brag about it on Facebook and Twitter! Mad Skills Motocross is fun for novices but deep enough for nearly endless competitive high-level play. You’ll need to master wheelies, stoppies, nitro, rocket boots, backflips, front flips, and much more to truly be the best.

See what players of the desktop version of Mad Skills Motocross have known since 2009: it’s the best side-scrolling motocross game ever made.

STORY

In the distant future, the only sentient beings in the world are robots. 

They are the last remnant of the human spirit. 

However, mankind is not dead. 

Technology exists that is capable of transferring memories to these robots. 

But with limited space, new memories will gradually overwrite the old. 

To prevent the emotions in human memories from fading away, the robots resorted to converting the emotions to music, and storing them in a place called Cytus. 

The robots use these songs to experience human emotion and dream that souls exists in each of them...

46,The Simpsons™: Tapped Out,"THIS GAME IS LIFE-RUININGLY FUN!
From the writers of The Simpsons, comes the city building game that lets you create your own living, breathing Springfield! When Homer accidently causes a meltdown that wipes out Springfield, it’s up to you to clean up his mess… we mean, help him rebuild it!
                                                                                                                                                                                           Collect Your Favorite Characters                                                                                                                  
Help reunite Homer with his loved ones - Marge, Lisa, Maggie (and even sometimes Bart) – as well as his not so loved ones, like Ned Flanders. Re-populate Springfield with your favorite characters, from Barflies (Barney Gumble) to Wise Guys (Fat Tony). Add them all, we won’t judge! Dress your characters to the nines with options like Daredevil Bart or Lizard Queen Lisa, and relive scenes from your favorite episodes of The Simpsons!
                                                                                                                                                                                                               Take Charge of Your Springfield
Can’t control your own life? Now you can control the lives of the citizens of Springfield instead! Make Apu work ridiculously long shifts at the Kwik-E-Mart, have Moe smuggle illegal animals, or make Homer toil poolside all day… that last one might not be so bad.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Build Your Own Springfield
Think Homer deserves to live next door to Moe’s? Or the monorail can survive a few more sharp twists and turns? Or Krustyland needs 40% more cartoon violence and 40% fewer health inspectors? Well you can finally make Springfield just the way you want it! Expand your town to the Waterfront, grow its businesses with the glamourous shops of Springfield Heights, and enjoy its sights, all with only a few taps.

85,Ingress,"Ingress transforms the real world into the landscape for a global game of mystery, intrigue, and competition.

Our future is at stake. You must choose a side.

A mysterious energy has been unearthed by a team of scientists in Europe. The origin and purpose of this force is unknown, but some researchers believe it is influencing the way we think. We must control it or it will control us.

“The Enlightened” seek to embrace the power that this energy may bestow upon us. “The Resistance” struggle to defend, and protect what’s left of our humanity.

Install Ingress and transform your world.

The World is the Game
Move through the real world using your iOS device and the Ingress app to discover and tap sources of this mysterious energy. Acquire objects to aid in your quest, deploy tech to capture territory, and ally with other players to advance the cause of the Enlightened or the Resistance.

Strategy
The struggle is being played out globally. Track the progress of players around the world, plan your next steps, and communicate with others using an Intelligence map.

Form Alliances
The struggle to save the planet spans the entire world. Groups of people acting together can be more effective than individuals acting alone. Cooperation across neighborhoods, cities, and countries will be needed to achieve the ultimate victory.

Note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

NOTE: This game requires at least 512 megs of ram to run properly; low-memory devices such as the iPod gen 3 and 4 will crash during gameplay. If you have a newer device this shouldn't be a problem! 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.

From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?

Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!

In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!

What could go wrong?

As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.

As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment."

**** NOTE FROM THE CREATOR ****
When I made this game, I wanted to create a game that all ages could play. Something that would be fun and cool for everyone. I wanted to eliminate blood and gore, heavy violence, and release something that was positive and up lifting. There are enough violent games out there. It was time for a new type of game that simply doesn't exist. However, this game does have very minimal cartoon/fantasy violence towards dogs and humans, but it's for a specific reason. I wanted to show and highlight what an actual crime-fighting K9 could endure. The game was never made with the intention to glamorize harming dogs as ""cool"""" or """"fun"""". The only intention of this game is to provide the world with something new"

ABOUT US
Choices is by the team that first created story games for mobile over a decade ago. Later we created Surviving High School and Cause of Death, the first games with episodes, for EA.

Both games hit the Top 25 and were inspirations for other companies. After leaving EA, our team regrouped in a small office and with the quacking of nearby ducklings we set out to create story-driven games with heart. As Pixelberry, we launched two hit games, High School Story and Hollywood U.

Our team has now grown to over a dozen of the most experienced game writers in the industry. In our 10 years of creating story games together, we’ve seen heartbreak, marriages, great adventures, and even Pixelbabies.

But even through diaper changes and late nights, we think we’ve created our best work to date. We hope you’ll fall in love with our newest characters, Chris, James, Kaitlyn, Dave, and Sam just as we have.

Enjoy,

- The Pixelberry Team"

197,Out There Chronicles - Ep. 1,"Out There Chronicles is an interactive graphic novel based on the science fiction universe of Out There, the acclaimed, multi-award-winning space exploration game.
 
After a slumber of a million years, you wake up on America, a planet colonized by humans who fled planet Earth. In your quest to find your people, you’ll set off on a galactic adventure where you’ll meet a host of colorful characters and visit unimaginable locations.

Out There Chronicles is a unique adventure set several million years before Out There.  Where do the Arks come from? What are the Cubes? Fans of the original game will find answers to some questions, but others will remain a mystery.  
You’ll also meet various alien races and get the opportunity to learn more about their people… If you can master their language, of course.  

In this universe that is so far from your own in distance and in time, a sharp mind and an instinct for survival are your only weapons. Friendships can be forged and ancient rivalries re-emerge through your encounters with almost-human and less-human races. Will you be able to distinguish friend from foe?
As in the original game, a single human is unable to face the forces of the universe alone. Achieve your goals by exercising diplomacy when needed, and seizing opportunities when they present themselves.  

Written by FibreTigre, author of the original game, Out There Chronicles offers an epic story that will delight science fiction fans in search of new experiences.  
Brilliantly illustrated by top French SF artist, Benjamin Carré, and equipped with a simple interface, Out There Chronicles will take you on a journey of adventure, even if you’ve never played a video game before.

Features
• 80 achievements
• An interactive science fiction graphic novel written by FibreTigre (Out There)
• A complex dialogue system: your choices can have consequences later in the adventure
• Master the alien language and discover their cultures
• Stunning, varied environments

• Revelations on the Out There universe
• A simple, accessible interface
• Magnificent illustrations by Benjamin Carré, the French master of science fiction
